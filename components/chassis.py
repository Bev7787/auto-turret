# this is the chassis class, a good example of a component. it is a
# bit special in that it has to take direct numerical input from the
# joystick (which is achieved by changing the 'input' variable, which
# is a list composed of [vx, vy, vz, throttle]) but is a good example
# of what a component should look like.
